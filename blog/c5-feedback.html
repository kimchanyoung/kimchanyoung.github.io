      Pairing with people to solve challenges is more fun and rewarding than I'd feared. I'm more of a quiet thinker (I'm still very collaborative, future employers! Ha.. ha), and so I was worried that interacting with another person throughout my thinking processes would slow me down or distract me.

      But on the contrary, I found myself being pleasantly challenged. I benefitted in a myriad ways -- when my partner knew something that I didn't, I learned new ways of doing things or thinking, and had the opportunity to ask questions. When I knew something that my partner didn't, I solidified my understanding of the concepts by explaining it.

      All the feedback that I've received was very pleasant and informative. I think one overarching theme has been just to be pleasant and kind throughout the process. No one wants to work with a bunghole.

      Writing feedback is a lot harder than receiving feedback (at least for now I guess, since no feedback has been particularly harsh). I want to be actionable, specific, and kind, but I don't always really know what to say. It helps to write feedback immediately after pairing sessions though. But really, my meta-feedback is a lot worse than my feedback. Sorry peers.

      I'm really excited to get on site and work with my cohort. I got to visit the site the other day, and it seems like a really exciting environment to be collaborating with people in.
