        Version control is the means by which one can save and track changes made to a file -- namely, code. Rather than overwriting save files to update a file, version control keeps a log of changes made to that file. This allows for easy navigation, reversion (if necessary), and tracking progress.
    </p>
    <p>
        Git is the developer's version control system of choice. This is especially important because collaboration is key to writing especially large pieces of code. Multiple developers working on the same file could be disastrous if there was no way to discern who made the changes, when the changes were made, and what exactly the changes were. Git tracks the changes that are made to a file, and helps to seamlessly merge multiple developers' code by saving updated save versions as a series of "commits."

    <p>
        GitHub is git in the cloud. It greatly expands the number of collaborators that can work on a project because it push a repository online, where users can pull it and use it to their liking. They can then suggest "commits" for peers to review and approve.
