      Thoughts on Programming and Surgery and Jobs and Money

      Sorry if this sounds pretentious. And if it's rambly.

      I started reading again. Maybe I was trying to impress my avid-reader father-in-law with interesting conversation topics. That's why I started reading the news (FYI now I read it because I'm a grown-up with genuine interests in current affairs). Naw, I was just interested in the book and couldn't afford to buy new books. I usually only like dumb fantasy novels like the Kingkiller Chronicles (not dumb) and the Mistborn Trilogy (also not dumb), but I most recently picked up "The Checklist Manifesto" by Atul Gawande. I received it as part of my SWAG package when I onboarded at Yext 2 years ago. At the time, I chalked it up to some CEO-101-Blog/Magazine-Steve-Jobs-copycat-inspired attempt at employee brainwashing, so it really just sat around collecting dust for a while. Water bottles and T-shirts make better swag, I think.

      ANYWAY. The book follows surgeon Atul Gawande on his revelatory discovery of the checklist -- how he first encountered its use & success in the field of aviation, his experimenting with their application in the operation room, and his journey of global checklist-evangelism upon discovering that using checklists could reduce potentially fatal accidents in surgery by a billion percent. I can't remember the exact figures, but they were very drastic. The gist of it is that even though one can have a certain level of expertise, checklists DRASSSTICALLY prevent room for human error. It was a little disconcerting, hearing about the frequencies at which medical practitioners forget crucial steps like administering antibiotics x number of hours before surgery, sterilizing entry points, etc. But I mean, that's why he wrote the book and stuff, right?

      His anecdotes are gripping -- they deal with real-life-life-or-death situations, after all, and he makes a really good case for checklists. Heck, I'm a believer. But as he described some of the exact procedures of the particularly complex surgeries that checklists helped him perform, I couldn't help but see kind of a parallel between surgery and programming in that at the real core of both, they are system comprehension and problem solving.

    I get that surgery is way harder than programming. Like expoentially. And people don't (always) die when you make a bug. AND I GET IT, PEOPLE HAVE PROBABLY MADE THIS COMPARISON TO DEATH BUT STILL -- the human body is really just a really complex system. That was one of the "Aha" moments for me in my biochem/orgo days. You learn how molecules like to interact with each other because of their electrons... and then proteins are just what happens when you get a lot of those interacting with each other. Right? Like those little now-banned bucky-ball magnet toys. It's easy to understand why 2 of them attract; they're magnets. But then you add a bunch of them, but the rules don't change; there're just many more players in the game so it looks more complex. You just keep scaling that up, with specialized molecules forming specialized organs performing specialized functions -- all still the same little bucky-balls, following the same rules, just way more complex because there're now loads of them. Loads and loads and loads. And the differentiator between Dr. Gawande and Mr. Joe Schmoe Cinderblock is that Dr. Gawande can capture those interactions in his mind, whereas for Mr. Cinderblock, it's an incomprehensible black box. And Dr. Gawande can be a doctor and cut people open and fix the broken things because he has the system knowledge, an understanding of the many parts and interactions that make up a body, as well as the problem solving skills to put things back where they belong. You give Mr. Cinderblock a scalpel and have him cut open a body, he sees red blobs and blood and just a mess of nothing. Dr Gawande can see how that heart is pumping deoxygenated blood to the lungs, liver doing <insert medical-sounding liver functions here>, stomach <similar-sounding stomach functions>, kidn.. you get the point. It's like a thing that makes sense to this guy. He can cut stuff open, cut stuff OUT, clamp things together, sew things shut, and the machine will just keep on running.

      I guess it's not totally the same because programming is inherently creative, and medicine is (for now) only reparative. But bug-fixing is reparative. I can't pretend to have much knowledge, but I have learned that one of the most invaluable things as a developer is a deep understanding of the system. I don't think you can have a good developer without the ability to internalize and quickly grow an intimate familiarity with his given software. No, this goes for just programming too though and not just fixing bugs. You have to be able to grasp and play with specialized structures, flows of data, and complex interactions in your mind.

      Whenever I'm faced with a task that's even a little bit architectural in its nature, I wrestle with it a lot and it takes me a while to come up with a solution that I think isn't total crap. It's hard. But I like that a lot. It's a lot of fun. I hope I get better at it.

      Oh also, a great quote from the book (I was taught to not leave free-standing quotes without explanations or supporting thoughts or something like this but oh well I hope you're still proud of me Mr. Sweeney, it was really great seeing you at the Chinese restaurant that one time and sorry that I didn't contact the Board of Ed to give you props like I said I would):

      "No, the real lesson is that under conditions of true complexity -- where the knowledge required exceeds that of any individual and unpredictability reigns -- efforts to dictate every step from the center will fail. People need room to act and adapt. Yet they cannot succeed as isolated individuals, either -- that is anarchy. Instead, they require a seemingly contradictory mix of freedom and expectation -- expectation to coordinate, for example, and also to measure progress toward common goals."

      Does that quote contradict the things I said? I don't know. It's a good book though -- you should read it.
