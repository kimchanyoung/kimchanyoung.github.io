      Questions
    </h2>
    <p>
      In order to ask a good question, one should:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>Be concise and intelligible</li>
        <li>Provide relevant information</li>
        <li>Be nice</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      You're asking your potential answerers to answer a question, so don't make them waste time decoding what you're asking. Be quick and concise, and get to the point. And make yourself understood.
