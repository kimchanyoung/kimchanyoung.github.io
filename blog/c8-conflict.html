      Conflicts
    </h2>
    <p>
      When I was in 4th grade, I was building a snow fort. My best friend Andrew, for reasons I can't remember, broke my snow fort or threw snow balls at me or something. I can't remember how the fight escalated, but we ended up in a fist fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The source of the conflict was that Andrew was being a jerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt angry and proud, because I felt as though I was in the right.
    </p>

      We ended up getting caught by my mom, who reprimanded us and forced us to talk. We sat around for a while and then we talked it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't think that I would have changed anything; it makes for a pretty entertaining story.
    </p>

      From this experience, I learned that fist fighting doesn't get you anywhere in terms of conflict resolution, but when done with the right person, builds life-long friendships.
