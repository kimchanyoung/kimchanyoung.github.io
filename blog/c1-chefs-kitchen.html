        Dev Bootcamp's curriculum seems really... holisitic. Shereef uses words like "transformative," which makes me wonder if I've inadverdently joined a cult. Haha.. just kidding. The ways that the curriculum seems to be built and is constantly being transformed seems to be geared to make developers who haven't just been taught a trade, but rather are taught to think a certain way. This is really reassuring. Shereef's comment on how we shouldn't expect a prepackaged software to consume and leave makes me both excited and nervous at the same time.

        DBC seems really determined to make you WORK, and to make you work with OTHERS. I'm a little bit disorganized so I'm concerned about staying on top of things, but I'm excited to learn from/with my peers, to make new friends, and to learn how to do cool stuff.

        I wish the recording was a better quality or that there was a transcribed version, though. Heh.
