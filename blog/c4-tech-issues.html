      One issue that the tech industry currently faces is device security. As increasing numbers of devices become connected to networks (see: Internet of Things), the IT security industry will have to prepare for new and unforeseen areas of hacking/infiltration. Most people are familiar with compromised security on devices obviously connected to networks like computers, phones, and ATMS, but the number of hack-able devices is quickly increasing.

      For instance, a recently popularized YouTube video depicts hackers remotely taking control of a Chrysler automobile, messing with the radio, AC unit, and EVEN THE WHOLE CAR. THEY JUST STOPPED THE CAR WITH A COMPUTER. IMAGINE YOU'RE MAKING TOAST AND A HACKER BURNS YOUR TOAST OR EVEN WORSE SETS YOUR HOUSE ON FIRE. IMAGINE YOU'RE TAKING A SHOWER AND THE WATER TURNS ICE COLD. AND THEN LAVA HOT. AND THEN ICE COLD AGAIN. CAN YOU EVEN IMAGINE THE LEVEL OF DISTRUST THAT WOULD CAUSE?

      I WAS LISTENING TO SOME ENGINEERS AT MY COMPANY TALK ABOUT GOING TO DEFCON, THE HACKER CONFERENCE. HE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT USING A BURNER PHONE & LAPTOP, AND STICKING A CORK IN HIS BUTT FOR EXTRA SECURITY MEASURES.

      LET'S TALK ABOUT KILLER ROBOTS. THE NEXT GENERATION OF WARFARE MAY BE WITH ROBOTS EQUIPPED WITH WEAPONS. SOUNDS PRETTY COOL, HUH. BUT CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THEY GOT INTO THE WRONG HANDS? YOU KNOW WHO'S WORRIED ABOUT THIS? STEPHEN HAWKING AND ELON MUSK. THAT'S RIGHT. STEPHEN FREAKING HAWKING AND ELON FREAKING MUSK. IF TWO OF THE BRIGHTEST MINDS IN THE WORLD TELL YOU "HEY, BE CAREFUL WITH THAT," YOU MAKE SURE YOU'RE CAREFUL WITH IT.

      So one of the huge issues in the tech industry is security in the myriad devices that will connect to networks.
