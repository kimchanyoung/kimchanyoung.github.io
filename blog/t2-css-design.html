     Man, I hate CSS. For now.
    </h2>
    <p>
      With HTML & CSS, one has a fairly limited toolkit. At least, for now. HTML is comprised of a bunch of simple blocks called "tags," which represent different units of information. For instance, the `h1` tag indicates a header and a `p` tag indicates a paragraph. Then CSS is used to format these objects in various manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, say for example that we wanted to make all the paragraphs blue. We can use CSS to style all the paragraphs blue. But what if we want to turn only 1 paragraph blue? What if we want to turn a select few paragraphs blue?
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter classes & ids. Classes and ids allow developers to name their HTML objects for reference in HTML. By grouping objects this way, one has greater control over customization. They are functionally very simliar. The greatest distinction is in the number of objects that the class/id will point to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Classes are used when multiple objects need to be referenced with the same name. If I have a couple of headers that I want to call "title," then I can make a class called "title" and invoke that in CSS. By using the notation .title, I can edit all the objects with that name at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      IDs are used for unique objects. If I have one particular thing that is unique, I can name it with an ID. If I wanted to make one paragraph called a "blog," I can give it the id "blog" and invoke it from CSS using #blog. One neat things about IDs is that you can stick a #ID at the end of a URL to be taken to the location of that ID.
