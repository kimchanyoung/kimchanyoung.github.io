      Affirmation & Stereotype Threat
    </h2>
    <p>
      When I think of the happiest, proudest, or most satisfied times in my life, the values from this one list that come to mind are:
      <ol>
        <ul>Accomplishment</ul>
        <ul>Adventure</ul>
        <ul>Community</ul>
        <ul>Faith</ul>
        <ul>Growth</ul>
        <ul>Having a Family</ul>
        <ul>Helping Society</ul>
        <ul>Inner Harmony</ul>
        <ul>Integrity</ul>
        <ul>Intellectual Status</ul>
        <ul>Meaningful Work</ul>
        <ul>Peace</ul>
        <ul>Security</ul>
        <ul>Serenity</ul>
        <ul>Truth</ul>
        <ul>Wisdom</ul>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      I would say that in general, I try my best to live upto these values. Like, a solid 5/5. At least a 4.5/5. 4/5 on bad days.
    </p>

      It's hard to say why these values are important to me. How do I summarize 23 years of growth and development, and analyze all the factors and influences that shaped me to value the things that I do now? The most recent value that I've spoken with anyone about is probably having a family. My fiancee and I are in the midst of planning a wedding and it's brought up conversations of how we want to respect each others' families in the process.

      The point of this blog exercise was to fill my utility belt with sources of self-affirmation when combating stereotype threat in my academic endeavors. But the instability of these values is the very reason failure is scary. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the concept of "affirming one's self-worth."
