   Arrays and Hashes
  </h2>
    <p>
      Used in most programming languages, arrays and hashes are simply "collections" of things. They are sets of objects that can be used for different purposes. They both grow and shrink with the size of their collection, and both can hold different types of items.

      Arrays, noted by their use of square brackets "[]", can be thought of as an integer-indexed collection of objects. That is to say, each item in an array has an index value depending on its location in the array. The first object would have an index of 0, then the second object, 1, etc. They can be called by their index values in square brackets following the name of the array.

      For instance, in the array animals = ["cat", "dog", "pig",]. You can call "pig" by referencing animals[2]. There are also lots of other handy methods like sort, and join. Strings can be split into arrays using the "split" method, which is nice because it allows you to use array methods and iterate through the String word by word.

      Hashes, on the other hand, is a collection of key-value pairs. They are indexed as well, but not in integer order, but rather by the arbitrary key of the object type. One common analogy is a dictionary. Hashes are like dictionaries in that there is a "key" and "pair" value in the way dictionaries have "word" and "definition" values. Pairs in a hash are defined by unique keys.

      Hashes have neat functionalities as well, like giving default values to keys that don't exist. On the whole, hashes are better for more complex processes.
