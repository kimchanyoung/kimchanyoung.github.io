    Getting in my brain

    Okay, just to preface -- Maybe it's because of all the junk on my Facebok feed, but I'm fairly skeptical when it comes to these "know yourself" types of quizzes. See: the Barnum effect. That being said, according to "phenomenological researcher" Dr. Anthony F. Gregorc's test, I am an "abstract sequential" type thinker.
  </p>
  <p>
    The "abstract" bit refers to me "perceptual quality." In contrast to the "concrete" type, which utilizes the five senses to analyze tangible information in the present, an "abstract" type thinker allows one to visualize ideas using intuition and imagination.
  </p>
  <p>
    My "Ordering Ability" is of the "sequential" type, which means that I organize information in a linear, step-by-step manner using plans, rather than in random chunks.
  </p>

    According to his website, my type of learer likes to be heard, to analyze situations before action, and to apply logic. We learn best when we have access to experts/references (I do enjoy having guides in GPS), in stimulating environments, and working alone (I do enjoy working alone).
  </p>
  <p>
    Some things I may want to be mindful of are:
    <ol>
      <li>It's hard for me to work with people with differing opinions.</li>
      <li>I need ample time to deal with subjects thoroughly.</li>
      <li>I hate monotonous tasks</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    I subscribe more easily to the growth vs. fixed mindset idea. I know the dilemma of getting stuck on a task out of the fear of imperfection and showing myself a little grace in failing has been very helpful. In terms of applying the principle to my learning style, I am growing to appreciate peer-pairing and collaborating in situations where I would most likely normally prefer to work alone. Here's to you, DBC Mud Turtles. Thank for being awesome.
