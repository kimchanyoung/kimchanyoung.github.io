    Stereotype Threats
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Stereotype threat" is a term used to refer to a person's underperformance due to a fear of confirming a negative stereotype. The idea is that if a person faces a negative stereotype (e.g. Asians can't drive), that person is prone to perform significantly worse because the person is afraid of failure, which would confirm that stereotype. Research shows that this is an alarmingly widespread phenomenon.

      In one test conducted by Claude Steele, blacks and whites were given a test. When they were told that it would measure their intelligence, Steele found that blacks performed worse than the whites. When that information was withheld from a group, both parties performed virtually the same. In a similar test, women performed more poorly than men, and whites performed more poorly than Asians.

      I don't know if I can think of a relevant situation right now (I got a perfect score on my Driver's License exam... heh, heh) this seems indicative of a deeper, broken, human trait of wanting to please others. Or a fear of being seen as failures. What an oppressive life that is. We all need Jesus.
